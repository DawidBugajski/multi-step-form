## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

Challenges from creators:

- Complete each step of the sequence
- See a summary of their selections on the final step and confirm their order
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

I also added several features by myself:

- I added validation to each of the fields in the form in the first step
- The last message thanking you for your purchase displays the user's nickname, phone number and email address
